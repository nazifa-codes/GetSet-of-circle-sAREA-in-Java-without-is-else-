# 🌌 CircleLogic
“From radius to resonance—explore the geometry of clean code.”

## 🔍 Overview  
 CircleLogic is a minimalist Java class that models a circle with encapsulated properties like radius and color, and computes its area using Math.PI . Designed for clarity, modularity, and emotional resonance, this repo is perfect for beginners, educators, and anyone who loves clean OOP design.

 ## 🚀 Features
• 	✅ Encapsulated fields: radius , color 
• 	🧠 Getter & Setter methods for controlled access
• 	📐 Area calculation using Math.PI
• 	🎨 Color attribute for visual storytelling
• 	🔄 Easy to extend for GUI or game logic

## 💡 Sample Usage
Circle c = new Circle();
c.setRadius(5.0);
c.setColor("Sky Blue");

System.out.println("Radius: " + c.getRadius());
System.out.println("Color: " + c.getColor());
System.out.println("Area: " + c.getArea());
